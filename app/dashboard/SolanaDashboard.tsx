Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
                            </div>
                          </div>
                        );
                      })}
                    </div>
                  )}
                </div>
              </TabsContent>
            </Tabs>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main issues were missing closing brackets for several nested components and structures. I've added the necessary closing brackets to properly close:

1. The transaction mapping function
2. The transactions container div
3. The TabsContent component
4. The Tabs component
5. The main layout divs
6. The component function

The code should now be properly structured and all components should be correctly closed.
