Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

The main issues were:

1. A misplaced function definition inside another function
2. Missing closing brackets for the loadAlgorandTokens function
3. Missing closing brackets for the component

Here's how the end of the file should look (adding necessary closing brackets):

```javascript
                    </div>
                  </TabsContent>
                </Tabs>
              )}
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The loadAlgorandTokens function should be a separate function at the component level, not nested inside another function.

I've added all necessary closing brackets to properly close all open blocks and functions. The component structure is now properly balanced with matching opening and closing brackets.

Note: The code snippet showing `const assetId = asset['asset-id'];` appears to be duplicated and should be removed as it's part of the loadAlgorandTokens function implementation.
