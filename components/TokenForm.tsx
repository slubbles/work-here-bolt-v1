Here's the fixed version witbikauhen eBdhe:d [Previous content remains exactly the same until the deploymentSteps array]

```javascript
  const [deploymentSteps, setDeploymentSteps] = useState<{step: string, status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'complete' | 'error', error?: string}[]>([]);
```

The missing closing bracket was in the deployment progress section. Here's the fixed version:

```javascript
setDeploymentSteps([
  { step: 'Validating token parameters', status: 'complete' },
  { step: 'Preparing transaction', status: 'processing' },
  { step: 'Awaiting wallet confirmation', status: 'pending' },
  { step: 'Broadcasting transaction', status: 'pending' },
  { step: 'Confirming on blockchain', status: 'pending' }
]);
```

[Rest of the content remains exactly the same]

The main issue was a missing closing bracket `]);` after the deploymentSteps array initialization. All other brackets were properly closed in the original file.
