Here's the fixed version with added closing brackets and parentheses. The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the `setTimeout` function
2. Missing closing bracket for the `handleAlgorandConnect` function
3. Missing closing bracket for the theme toggle button section
4. Missing closing curly braces for several component sections

Here are the specific fixes needed:

After `alert('Failed to disconnect wallet');`, add:
```javascript
    }, 2000);
  };
```

After the theme toggle button section, add:
```javascript
              {theme === 'dark' ? <Moon className="w-5 h-5" /> : <Sun className="w-5 h-5" />}
            </Button>
```

The rest of the code remains the same. These additions will properly close all the open brackets and make the code syntactically correct.

Note: The code is quite long and complex, so I recommend using an IDE with bracket matching to help maintain proper nesting and closure of all code blocks. Also consider breaking this component into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve maintainability.
