Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the end of the waitForConfirmationWithRetry function:
    }
  }
  
  throw new Error(`Transaction not confirmed after ${maxRounds} rounds on ${network}`);
}

// Inside the network-card div, after the network.color closing brace:
                    <div className={`w-3 h-3 rounded-full ${network.color}`} />

// After the error handling for transaction confirmation:
    try {
      confirmedTxn = await waitForConfirmationWithRetry(algodClient, txId, 20, network);
    } catch (confirmError) {
      console.error(`‚ùå Transaction confirmation failed on ${network}:`, confirmError);
      throw new Error(`Transaction submitted but not confirmed on ${network}. Please check the explorer for transaction status. TX ID: ${txId}`);
    }

// At the very end of the file:
}
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the waitForConfirmationWithRetry function
2. Incomplete className template literal in the network card div
3. Missing closing brackets for the error handling block
4. Missing final closing bracket for the TokenForm component

The file should now be properly balanced with all required closing brackets.
