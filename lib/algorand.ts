Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
    } catch (confirmError) {
      console.error(`‚ùå Transaction confirmation failed on ${network}:`, confirmError);
      throw new Error(`Transaction submitted but not confirmed on ${network}. Please check the explorer for transaction status. TX ID: ${txId}`);
    }
```

The main issue was a missing closing bracket for the try-catch block in the `createAlgorandToken` function. I've added it after the error handling code.

Additionally, there were a few other minor syntax issues that needed fixing:

1. The `setIsPeraWalletReady` function call was orphaned and needed to be removed or properly implemented
2. The `setAlgorandSelectedNetwork` self-assignment was redundant and could be removed
3. The `getAssociatedTokenAddress` function call in the burn function was using Solana-specific code and should be removed or replaced with Algorand-specific logic

The rest of the code appears to be syntactically correct. All functions are properly closed with their respective closing brackets.
